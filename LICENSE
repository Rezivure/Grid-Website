                            Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.

This license, like the GNU General Public License, is a copyleft
license, which means that derivative works of the program must be free
software and carry the same terms. In this case, when you run a
modified program on a server and let other users interact with it, the
AGPL requires you to make the source code of your modified version
available to those users. These requirements apply to the modified
version as well as any associated programs that interact with it.

You are free to use this software under the following conditions:

- The code is made available under the AGPL-3.0 license.
- Any modifications made to the code must also be made publicly available under the same license.
- If you make the program available to users through a network (for example, as a web application), you must make the modified source code available to those users under the AGPL-3.0.

You may use this software as-is, without warranty of any kind, and you may redistribute it and modify it as long as you comply with the conditions of the AGPL-3.0 license.
